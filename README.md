# quilsteroids

An Asteroids clone written in Clojure with Quil.

## Usage

Far from a perfect clone, but a fun excuse to play around a bit.

Controls:
- Left/Right arrow keys rotate the ship
- Up arrow key thrusts forwards
- Shift shoots
- Escape exits

Expectations: Definitely not a full clone! In particular,
- No sound
- No score-keeping
- Infinite lives
- No UFOs
- No asteroid field refresh when the field is cleared
- No teleportation
- Asteroid art doesn't match

The list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Hope you have fun playing and fiddling with the code!
